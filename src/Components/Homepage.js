            <h1>Welcome to The Shoppies!</h1>

            <p>As a hardcore movie lover, the Executive Board of The Shoppies needs your help. There are so many great movies to choose from for this year's Shoppie Awards that we are unable to shortlist a good amount for the show.                
            </p>

            <p>So this year, it is up to you, our fellow moviegoers, to choose your top 5 choices that you believe deserve a Shoppie Award this year. Feel free to check out the list of movies by clicking on the Search tab above and looking through the list to find your favorite movies. Once you choose your top 5 favorite movies, you will be notified that your submission is ready.</p>

            <p>From there, you can choose to either submit your nominations to the Board or you can change any of your nominations by removing them from your list.</p>

            <p>The Shoppies Executive Board thanks you wholeheartedly for participating in this year's award process and we look forward to seeing the results we have to choose from in the near future!</p>
