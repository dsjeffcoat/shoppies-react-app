# Shoppies React App for Shopify Challenge

The following project is my submission for the Shopify Coding Challenge for the 2021 Summer Internship. Features within the project are as follows:

- Movie search through OMDB API
- Ability to nominate movies to your favorites
- Ability to remove picked nominations through a nominations modal
- Modal presented when all five nominees are selected

OMDB API Primary Source: http://www.omdbapi.com/

Please check out the live demo of the application in the link below:

## Additional Notes:

Originally I wanted to submit this as a static application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery, but there were issues with the local storage syncing correctly. Because of this, I converted the application to a React application to solve these issues. I'm looking towards adding authentication and a backend database to the project soon in the future, but did not have enough time to add those additional features.
